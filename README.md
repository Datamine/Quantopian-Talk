Slides/Transcript from a talk I gave on Fama-French Factors and Naive Parameter Optimization

Note that the quality of images in the pdf has been compressed to .jpg, which is inferior to the original .pngs. 
I haven't looked at the .pptx -- I generated it automatically for your convenience. 

There are two subfolders:
* images-slides contains all the slides in image form (.png)  
* raw-images-for-slides contains all the images I used to create the slides.

You can see the full transcript of the presentation at www.johnloeber.com/docs/fama.html.
